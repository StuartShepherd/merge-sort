# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing the unsorted list into n sub-lists until each sub-list contains only one element, then merging these sub-lists back together to form a single sorted list. 
During the merging process, the algorithm compares elements from the sub-lists and selects the smaller element, putting it in the correct order in the final list.
